Embedding has numerous advantages:
  -data locality
  -no need for expensive joins
  -atomic updates

There are several disadvantages:
  -hard size of 16 MB
  -growing documents can result in data fragementation / performance issues
  (can mitigate this somewhat with pre-initialization in batch format)
  -Mongo cannot search deeply nested data structures efficiently?

Big consideration - can embedding the documents allow you to retrieve the 
information you want correctly?
  i.e. is there any situation where you would want to get a collection of 
  orders distinct from there patients?

First pass -> let's go with embedded but recognize that this severely limits
flexibility. I.e. if we wanted to do analysis on orders made, for example,
rather than looking at patients.

Basically embedding everything in patients means we are always patient focused 
rather than anything else
