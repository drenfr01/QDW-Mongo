Basics of model:

Patient has references to:
  Assessments
  Problems
  Orders
  Results
  Vitals

These should all be part of a polymorphic class ideally, perhaps
a Patient Attribute Class.

The open question is, whether to make these all part of the same collection?
  -> drawbacks to having 1, extremely populated collection?
  -> any benefits to separating out orders, assessments, etc.?
